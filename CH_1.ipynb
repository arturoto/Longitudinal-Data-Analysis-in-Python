    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Often, there is a lack of available computer software for application of these more complex statistical models, or the level of statistical sophistication required of the user is beyond the typical level of the practitioner. In certain cases, for example nonlinear models for binary, ordinal, or nominal endpoints, parameter estimation can be computationally intensive due to the need for numerical or Monte Carlo simulation methods to evaluate the likelihood of nonlinear mixed-effects regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* more likely that there are missing data due to attrition\n",
    "* the values of the predictors or independent variables can also change over time\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"The treatment of time-varying covariates in analysis of longitudinal data permits much stronger statistical inferences about dynamical relationships than can be obtained using cross-sectional data. The price, however, is considerable added complexity to the statistical model.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"repeated measurements involve different conditions that the same subjects are exposed to. A classic example is a crossover design in which two or more treatments are given to the same subject in different orders\"\n"

    "#### 1.5 ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different features of longitudinal studies that must be considered when selecting an appropriate longitudinal analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. form of the outcome or response measure:\n",
    "    * continuous and normally distributed(e.g.,a mixed-effects linear regression model)\n",
    "    * continuous but does not have a normal distribution( e.g.,acount), then alternative nonlinear models ( e.g., a mixed-effects Poisson regression model)\n",
    "    * For qualitative outcomes,such as binary(yes or no),ordinal( e.g.,sad,neutral, happy), or nominal (republican, democrat, independent), more complex nonlinear models are also typically required.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. number of subjects $N$:\n",
    "    * The more advanced models ( e.g., generalized mixed-effects regression models) that are appropriate for analysis of unbalanced longitudinal data are based on large sample theory and may be inappropriate for analysis of small N studies (e.g.,N < 50).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. number of observations per subject $n_i$:\n",
    "    * When $n_i = n$ for all subjects, the design is said to be balanced, and traditional ANOVA or MANOVA models for repeated measurements ( i.e., traditional mixed-effects models or multivariate growth curve models) can be used. \n",
    "    * In the most general case where $n_i$ varies from subject to subject, more general methods are required ( e.g., generalized mixed-effects regression models)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. number and type of covariates is an important consideration for model selection for $E(\\mathbf{y_i})$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. selection of a plausible variance-covariance structure for the $V(\\mathbf{y_i})$:\n",
    "    * Different model specificationslead to\n",
    "        - (a) homogeneous or heterogeneous variances\n",
    "        - (b) homogeneous or heterogeneous covariances of the repeated measurements over time.\n",
    "    * Residual autocorrelation among the responses may also play a role in modeling the variance-ccwariance structure of the data."
