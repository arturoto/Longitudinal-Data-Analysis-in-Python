    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Often, there is a lack of available computer software for application of these more complex statistical models, or the level of statistical sophistication required of the user is beyond the typical level of the practitioner. In certain cases, for example nonlinear models for binary, ordinal, or nominal endpoints, parameter estimation can be computationally intensive due to the need for numerical or Monte Carlo simulation methods to evaluate the likelihood of nonlinear mixed-effects regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* more likely that there are missing data due to attrition\n",
    "* the values of the predictors or independent variables can also change over time\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"The treatment of time-varying covariates in analysis of longitudinal data permits much stronger statistical inferences about dynamical relationships than can be obtained using cross-sectional data. The price, however, is considerable added complexity to the statistical model.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"repeated measurements involve different conditions that the same subjects are exposed to. A classic example is a crossover design in which two or more treatments are given to the same subject in different orders\"\n"
