    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Often, there is a lack of available computer software for application of these more complex statistical models, or the level of statistical sophistication required of the user is beyond the typical level of the practitioner. In certain cases, for example nonlinear models for binary, ordinal, or nominal endpoints, parameter estimation can be computationally intensive due to the need for numerical or Monte Carlo simulation methods to evaluate the likelihood of nonlinear mixed-effects regression models.\n",

    "#### 1.5 ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different features of longitudinal studies that must be considered when selecting an appropriate longitudinal analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. form of the outcome or response measure:\n",
    "    * continuous and normally distributed(e.g.,a mixed-effects linear regression model)\n",
    "    * continuous but does not have a normal distribution( e.g.,acount), then alternative nonlinear models ( e.g., a mixed-effects Poisson regression model)\n",
    "    * For qualitative outcomes,such as binary(yes or no),ordinal( e.g.,sad,neutral, happy), or nominal (republican, democrat, independent), more complex nonlinear models are also typically required.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. number of subjects $N$:\n",
    "    * The more advanced models ( e.g., generalized mixed-effects regression models) that are appropriate for analysis of unbalanced longitudinal data are based on large sample theory and may be inappropriate for analysis of small N studies (e.g.,N < 50).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. number of observations per subject $n_i$:\n",
    "    * When $n_i = n$ for all subjects, the design is said to be balanced, and traditional ANOVA or MANOVA models for repeated measurements ( i.e., traditional mixed-effects models or multivariate growth curve models) can be used. \n",
    "    * In the most general case where $n_i$ varies from subject to subject, more general methods are required ( e.g., generalized mixed-effects regression models)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. number and type of covariates is an important consideration for model selection for $E(\\mathbf{y_i})$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. selection of a plausible variance-covariance structure for the $V(\\mathbf{y_i})$:\n",
    "    * Different model specificationslead to\n",
    "        - (a) homogeneous or heterogeneous variances\n",
    "        - (b) homogeneous or heterogeneous covariances of the repeated measurements over time.\n",
    "    * Residual autocorrelation among the responses may also play a role in modeling the variance-ccwariance structure of the data."

    "#### 1.6 GENERAL APPROACHES\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. “derived variable” approach:\n",
    "    * reduction of the repeated measurements into a summary variable. Once reduced, this approach is strictly not longitudinal, a t-test is fine.\n",
    "    * Examples of derived variables include \n",
    "        - (a) average across time\n",
    "        - (b) linear trend across time, \n",
    "        - (c) carrying the last observation forward, \n",
    "        - (d) computing a change score, and\n",
    "        - (e) computing the area under the curve.\n",
    "    * In the unbalanced case ( e.g., drop-outs) therefore violate homoscedasticity.\n",
    "    *  reducing multiple repeated measurements to a single summary measurement: substantial loss of statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ANOVA - Simple but most restrictive\n",
    "    * The model assumes compound symmetry which implies constant variances and covariances over time.\n",
    "    * Subjects don't always deviate from only baseline.\n",
    "3. MANOVA\n",
    "    * In the multivariate case, the repeated observations are generally trans- formed to orthogonal polynomial coefficients, and these coefficients ( eg., constant, linear, quadratic growth rates) are then used as multivariate responses in a MANOVA.\n",
    "    * does not permit missing data or different measurement occasions for different subjects.\n",
    "4. generalized mixed-effects regression models - widely used for analysis of longitudinal data (“full-likelihood”)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * can be applied to both normally distributed continuous outcomes as well as categorical outcomes and other nonnormally distributed outcome\n",
    "    *  robust to missing data and irregularly spaced measurement occasions and can easily handle both time-invariant and time-varying covariates\n",
    "    * The disadvantage: methods are more computationally complex\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. covariance pattern models\n",
    "    * variance-cwariance matrix of the repeated outcomes is modeled directly, and there is no attempt at distinguishing within-subjects variance from between-subjects variance\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. GEE Models - general and computationally convenient alternative to mixed-effects regression models\n",
    "    * Disadvantage: missingdataareonlyignorableif the missing data are explained by covariates in the model. (A little restrictive)\n",
