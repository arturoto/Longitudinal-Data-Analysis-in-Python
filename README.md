### Longitudinal Data Analysis in Python

The introduction of Multivariate analysis is relatively new in Python. Many current stacks do not have access to these libraries. This Repo will implement everything only using Linear Algebra and will try to give a brief explanation as to why it works. Because of its, I guess, low level implementation, you’d have access to modify the code as you like. 

If any of this code is useful to you, go ahead and copy/paste it to your work!

If you’d like to contribute or correct anything go ahead and clone, fork or message me!

I am following the book Longitudinal Data Analysis By Donald Hedeker and Robert Gibbs. Pretty much everything I use in this repo comes directly from that book, except the code.
